### Hey!

I'm a web developer passionate about **hacking stuff**.

I primarily work with TypeScript as a full-stack developer nowdays.

Here are a few of my interesting projects:

- [ibis](https://github.com/th3rius/ibis) - A modern [SoulSeek](http://www.slsknet.org/) client
- [raven](https://github.com/th3rius/raven) - A public music metadata GraphQL API
- [endpointer](https://github.com/th3rius/endpointer) - A tool for locating endpoints on JS files
- [.dotfiles](https://github.com/th3rius/.dotfiles) - My personal dotfiles

I [maintain](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?&SeB=m&K=th3rius) a handful of packages for [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/). I also contribute to a few other open source projects.

I sometimes write [blog](https://nocnitsa.com/) posts and occasionally [tweet](https://twitter.com/gabhk3) about stuff. Feel free to reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabrielhk3/) about **job-related** matters.
